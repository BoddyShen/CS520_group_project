## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Welcome to our project, an innovative platform built on the cutting-edge technology stack of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, TypeScript, and Redux. Our application is designed to cater to the dynamic needs of modern web users, offering a suite of powerful features wrapped in a sleek and responsive user interface.

## Core Features

**Member Management**: Our system offers comprehensive tools for user registration, profile management. Whether you're looking to manage user roles or maintain user data, our platform provides a robust solution tailored to your needs.

**Matching System**: Our matching system currently pairs users randomly, providing immediate connections among unpaired members. We plan to enhance this feature with sophisticated algorithms for more personalized matches in the future.

**Chatting Room**: At the heart of our platform is a real-time chatting room, powered by WebSocket technology for live publish/subscribe updates. This feature allows users to communicate instantly, facilitating engaging conversations and interactions.

# Technology Highlights

**Shadcn/UI & TypeScript**: The use of Shadcn/UI components alongside TypeScript ensures a consistent and error-free development experience, enhancing the scalability and maintainability of our codebase.

**Redux & Zustand State Management**: For global state management, we employ a hybrid approach using Redux for predictable state container logic and Zustand for a more flexible and lightweight state management solution. This combination allows for efficient state updates and easy integration across our application.

**WebSocket for Real-Time Communication**: The chatting room feature is built on WebSocket technology, ensuring real-time message exchange without the need for constant polling. This enables a highly responsive and interactive user experience.
